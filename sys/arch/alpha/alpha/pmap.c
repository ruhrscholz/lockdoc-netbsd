/*
 * DEC Alpha physical map management code.
 *
 * History:
 *
 *	This pmap started life as a Motorola 68851/68030 pmap,
 *	written by Mike Hibler at the University of Utah.
 *
 *	It was modified for the DEC Alpha by Chris Demetriou
 *	at Carnegie Mellon University.
 *
 *	Support for non-contiguous physical memory was added by
 *	Jason R. Thorpe of the Numerical Aerospace Simulation
 *	Facility, NASA Ames Research Center and Chris Demetriou.
 *
 *	Page table management and a major cleanup were undertaken
 *	by Jason R. Thorpe, with lots of help from Ross Harvey of
 *	Avalon Computer Systems and from Chris Demetriou.
 *
 *	Support for the new UVM pmap interface was written by
 *	Jason R. Thorpe.
 *
 *	Support for ASNs was written by Jason R. Thorpe, again
 *	with help from Chris Demetriou and Ross Harvey.
 *
 *	The locking protocol was written by Jason R. Thorpe,
 *	using Chuck Cranor's i386 pmap for UVM as a model.
 *
 *	TLB shootdown code was written by Jason R. Thorpe.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *	All page table access is done via K0SEG.  The one exception
 *	to this is for kernel mappings.  Since all kernel page
 *	tables are pre-allocated, we can use the Virtual Page Table
 *	to access PTEs that map K1SEG addresses.
 *
 *	Kernel page table pages are statically allocated in
 *	pmap_bootstrap(), and are never freed.  In the future,
 *	support for dynamically adding additional kernel page
 *	table pages may be added.  User page table pages are
 *	dynamically allocated and freed.
 *
 *	This pmap implementation only supports NBPG == PAGE_SIZE.
 *	In practice, this is not a problem since PAGE_SIZE is
 *	initialized to the hardware page size in alpha_init().
 *
 * Bugs/misfeatures:
 *
 *	- Some things could be optimized.
 */

/*
 *	Manages physical address maps.
 *
 *	Since the information managed by this module is
 *	also stored by the logical address mapping module,
 *	this module may throw away valid virtual-to-physical
 *	mappings at almost any time.  However, invalidations
 *	of virtual-to-physical mappings must be done as
 *	requested.
 *
 *	In order to cope with hardware architectures which
 *	make virtual-to-physical map invalidates expensive,
 *	this module may delay invalidate or reduced protection
 *	operations until such time as they are actually
 *	necessary.  This module is given full information as
 *	to which processors are currently using which maps,
 *	and to when physical maps must be made correct.

/*
 * Address Space Numbers.
 *
 * On many implementations of the Alpha architecture, the TLB entries and
 * I-cache blocks are tagged with a unique number within an implementation-
 * specified range.  When a process context becomes active, the ASN is used
 * to match TLB entries; if a TLB entry for a particular VA does not match
 * the current ASN, it is ignored (one could think of the processor as
 * having a collection of <max ASN> separate TLBs).  This allows operating
 * system software to skip the TLB flush that would otherwise be necessary
 * at context switch time.
 *
 * Alpha PTEs have a bit in them (PG_ASM - Address Space Match) that
 * causes TLB entries to match any ASN.  The PALcode also provides
 * a TBI (Translation Buffer Invalidate) operation that flushes all
 * TLB entries that _do not_ have PG_ASM.  We use this bit for kernel
 * mappings, so that invalidation of all user mappings does not invalidate
 * kernel mappings (which are consistent across all processes).
 *
 * pmap_next_asn always indicates to the next ASN to use.  When
 * pmap_next_asn exceeds pmap_max_asn, we start a new ASN generation.
 *
 * When a new ASN generation is created, the per-process (i.e. non-PG_ASM)
 * TLB entries and the I-cache are flushed, the generation number is bumped,
 * and pmap_next_asn is changed to indicate the first non-reserved ASN.
 *
 * We reserve ASN #0 for pmaps that use the global kernel_lev1map.  This
 * prevents the following scenario:
 *
 *	* New ASN generation starts, and process A is given ASN #0.
 *
 *	* A new process B (and thus new pmap) is created.  The ASN,
 *	  for lack of a better value, is initialized to 0.
 *
 *	* Process B runs.  It is now using the TLB entries tagged
 *	  by process A.  *poof*
 *
 * In the scenario above, in addition to the processor using using incorrect
 * TLB entires, the PALcode might use incorrect information to service a
 * TLB miss.  (The PALcode uses the recursively mapped Virtual Page Table
 * to locate the PTE for a faulting address, and tagged TLB entires exist
 * for the Virtual Page Table addresses in order to speed up this procedure,
 * as well.)
 *
 * By reserving an ASN for kernel_lev1map users, we are guaranteeing that
 * new pmaps will initially run with no TLB entries for user addresses
 * or VPT mappings that map user page tables.  Since kernel_lev1map only
 * contains mappings for kernel addresses, and since those mappings
 * are always made with PG_ASM, sharing an ASN for kernel_lev1map users is
 * safe (since PG_ASM mappings match any ASN).
 *
 * On processors that do not support ASNs, the PALcode invalidates
 * the TLB and I-cache automatically on swpctx.  We still still go
 * through the motions of assigning an ASN (really, just refreshing
 * the ASN generation in this particular case) to keep the logic sane
 * in other parts of the code.

/*
 * Locking:
 *
 *	This pmap module uses two types of locks: `normal' (sleep)
 *	locks and `simple' (spin) locks.  They are used as follows:
 *
 *	READ/WRITE SPIN LOCKS
 *	---------------------
 *
 *	* pmap_main_lock - This lock is used to prevent deadlock and/or
 *	  provide mutex access to the pmap module.  Most operations lock
 *	  the pmap first, then PV lists as needed.  However, some operations,
 *	  such as pmap_page_protect(), lock the PV lists before locking
 *	  the pmaps.  To prevent deadlock, we require a mutex lock on the
 *	  pmap module if locking in the PV->pmap direction.  This is
 *	  implemented by acquiring a (shared) read lock on pmap_main_lock
 *	  if locking pmap->PV and a (exclusive) write lock if locking in
 *	  the PV->pmap direction.  Since only one thread can hold a write
 *	  lock at a time, this provides the mutex.
 *
 *	SIMPLE LOCKS
 *	------------
 *
 *	* pm_slock (per-pmap) - This lock protects all of the members
 *	  of the pmap structure itself.  This lock will be asserted
 *	  in pmap_activate() and pmap_deactivate() from a critical
 *	  section of cpu_switch(), and must never sleep.  Note that
 *	  in the case of the kernel pmap, interrupts which cause
 *	  memory allocation *must* be blocked while this lock is
 *	  asserted.
 *
 *	* pvh_slock (per-pv_head) - This lock protects the PV list
 *	  for a specified managed page.
 *
 *	* pmap_all_pmaps_slock - This lock protects the global list of
 *	  all pmaps.  Note that a pm_slock must never be held while this
 *	  lock is held.
 *
 *	Address space number management (global ASN counters and per-pmap
 *	ASN state) are not locked; they use arrays of values indexed
 *	per-processor.
 *
 *	All internal functions which operate on a pmap are called
 *	with the pmap already locked by the caller (which will be
 *	an interface function).
